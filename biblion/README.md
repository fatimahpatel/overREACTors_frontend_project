# Biblion - Online Bookshelf Front-End

## Project summary

Biblion is a React application that allows users to browse and write reviews of their favourite books. The front-end was developed by the **OverREACTors**, and was based off the API of the Online Bookshelf built by **merge no-conflict**.

OverREACTors: _Rebecca, Fatimah, Isabel_

Merge no-conflict: _Amy, Nadia, Bav_

The frontend was built using React (Javascript), CSS and HTML.

## Project Aims

As part of the MVP, we wanted the front-end to fetch all the books and their respective reviews from the backend, and display the information in a format that is readable to the user.
The client can then filter for books by their title (using a search bar) or genre (using a drop down list).

For the extensions, we aimed to implement the following:

- A Log-in section, where the user can input their details to be matched against the existing user database. If the details matched, the user information is stored and used across the app.
- An 'Add Review' section, where the user can write and submit their own reviews for their chosen book. This updates the API and the app displays the updated review.
